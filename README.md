# General-Signal-Generator
General Signal Generator is a user-friendly program that generates any possible combination of DC, ramp, exponential, polynomial and sinusoidal signals. The user is also able to perform multiple operations on the signal he generated, he can choose whether he wants his modifications to be on the original signal or on the previous modification.
The General Signal Generator is meant to be done in the easiest and most user friendly
way possible, that’s why it has a graphical user interfaceEach button prompts the user to make choices that define his desired signal:
● Initialize button
User is prompted to enter the following data:
- Sampling Frequency
- Start Time
- End Time

Select Function
The user gets to choose from multiple options for each breakpoint he entered [only one
signal if 0 breakpoints]:
1) DC signal
2) Ramp signal
3) Polynomial Signal
4) Exponential Signal
5) Sinusoidal Signal
The user then decides all attributes to the signal chosen:
1) DC signal - amplitude
2) Ramp signal - slope - intercept
3) General order polynomial: amplitude - power - intercept
4) Exponential signal: amplitude - exponent
5) Sinusoidal signal: amplitude - frequency - phase
6) To perform any operation, the user chooses from the drop down menu of
operations
After the user chooses the operation he desires from the drop down menu, he enters the
suitable value of shift/scale/compression or expansion and then clicks perform operation.
For more operations, the user gets to choose the operation he likes from the
drop down menu
User gets to choose if he wants to modify the original signal or the modified signal
(the most recent plot)
The user can modify the original function at each point of the program, if he desires
to see each change individually, he can also perform all his operations in a row, and
plot the final signal with all the changes combined.
